These are some example datasets.

simple ....... simple made-up input, also used in the synopsis in the User's Guide
complex ...... more complex (yet also made-up) input, shows well how fragment assembly works
rhodo ........ several exons from genes coding for rhodopsins in three different organisms
               (one of them being human); these genes therefore have similarities;
	       shows that pairwise alignment using *unbanded* Smith-Waterman can get pretty
               slow (quadratic complexity)
mouse ........ some salivary ESTs (expressed sequence tags - pieces of DNA restored from already
               translated messenger RNA) from the organism Mus Muscullus. These are some
	       randomly selected ESTs, so only few are actually similar. That is actually
	       quite common with ESTs.
