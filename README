-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a fragment assemly program. Only source code is provided, you need to compile it
first. To compile, ocamlc (the OCaml compiler) is required -- if you have OCaml installed,
this should not be a problem.

If you don't have OCaml, you can download it at:  http://caml.inria.fr

Next, see the "Compilation" section below.

=====Files:=====

frag_asm.ml   \ ........ source files in the OCaml functional language
similarity.ml /

Makefile ............... see next section for compilation instructions

doc/users_guide.pdf .... guide for the casual user 
doc/frag_asm.pdf ....... an informal treatment of programming methods used

example-data/ .......... a directory containing four datasets for experimentation
example-data/README .... a file describing the datasets

=====Compilation - run the following commands:=====

make all ............... to build the executable frag_asm (requires ocamlc!!)
make clean ............. to remove the ocaml bytecode files generated during the build

=====Quick start (*AFTER* compilation)=====

Read users_guide.pdf (especially if you don't know what fragment assembly is)
  
  OR
  
1. Copy the file example-data/simple.dat to this directory
2. Run the command "./frag_asm simple.dat simple.contigs simple.progress"
3. Look into the files 'simple.contigs' and 'simple.progress'
